🌿 Smart Plant Care – Plant Health Predictor

Smart Plant Care is an AI-powered web application that analyzes indoor plant images and predicts their health condition helping users know when their plants need water.


🧠 Project Overview

Many indoor plant owners struggle to determine when their plants need watering, often leading to overwatering or underwatering.
Our project uses a deep learning model to detect whether a plant is Healthy, Struggling, or Withered, based on an uploaded image.

The goal is to make plant care smarter, simpler, and more sustainable 🌱


⚙️ Technologies Used

	•	Frontend: Streamlit (for user interface)
	
	•	Backend: FastAPI (for model API)
	
	•	Model: VGG16 (Transfer Learning using TensorFlow/Keras)
	
	•	Deployment: Docker + Cloud Run
	
	•	Dataset: Kaggle – Healthy and Wilted Houseplant Images


💻 How It Works

	1.	The user uploads a photo of their plant.
	
	2.	The image is sent to the FastAPI model API.
	
	3.	The model analyzes the photo and predicts the plant’s condition.
	
	4.	The app displays the result and a short care tip.


Example Predictions

	•	✅ Healthy – Your plant looks great! Keep the same routine.
	
	•	⚠️ Struggling – Might need a bit more water or sunlight.
	
	•	❌ Withered – Try watering and trimming the dry leaves.
